## Purpose
The core objective of our fitness app is to offer users a comprehensive and integrated view of their fitness and nutritional profile by aggregating data from various sources. The app will harness the capabilities of APIs such as MyFitnessPal and Apple HealthKit, enabling seamless synchronization and amalgamation of critical health metrics. This integration will facilitate the tracking of food consumption, providing insights into macronutrient intake and total calories consumed, while simultaneously monitoring physical activities and workouts through data captured from these external platforms. By collating this diverse set of data, our app will present users with a holistic and in-depth analysis of their dietary habits and exercise routines, empowering them to make more informed decisions about their fitness and health objectives. The unique proposition of our app lies in its ability to consolidate and elegantly display all this information in a user-friendly format, providing a 360-degree view of the user's health and fitness journey.

## Target Audience

Our target audience includes individuals who are looking for a centralized solution to manage and view their fitness and nutritional data. This encompasses those who are already using platforms like MyFitnessPal for dietary tracking and Apple HealthKit for monitoring physical activities. Our app caters to users who value the convenience of having all their health and fitness information consolidated in one place. It is ideal for those keen on analyzing detailed health metrics from multiple sources and desiring a comprehensive overview of their fitness journey. By offering an integrated view that combines data from various APIs, our app is particularly suited for tech-savvy users who are utilizing multiple applications to track different aspects of their health and fitness regimes and seek to simplify this process.
