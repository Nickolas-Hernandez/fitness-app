## Purpose
The primary goal of our fitness app is to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their fitness and nutritional profile. This will be achieved by enabling users to track and analyze key data related to their energy intake and output. Specifically, the app will facilitate the logging of food consumption, providing insights into macro-nutrient intake and total calories consumed. Concurrently, it will track physical activities and workouts, calculating the calories burned. This dual approach ensures users have a complete view of their dietary habits and exercise routines, empowering them to make informed decisions about their fitness and health goals. The app's unique feature will be its ability to integrate and display all this data in an easily understandable format, offering users a 360-degree view of their fitness journey.

## Target Audience

Our target audience consists of individuals seeking a unified platform to access comprehensive fitness data. They are people who appreciate the detailed analytics found in apps like Apple Fitness, such as workout summaries and health metrics, and the dietary tracking features of MyFitnessPal, like calorie counting and nutritional information. Our app is designed for those who desire the convenience of monitoring both their physical activity and dietary habits in one integrated application, providing a holistic view of their health and fitness journey.
